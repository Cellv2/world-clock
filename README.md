## Important! .env File

Please add a .env file locally to your project. In this, depending on if you are using Windows or Linux/macOS, please add the below:

- Windows: SASS_PATH=./node_modules;./src

- Linux/MacOS: SASS_PATH=node_modules:src

You will most likely get errors around the styling if you do not do this. The source for the file paths for this can be found [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet/).

Make sure to restart node if you saw this message after you ran npm start!
